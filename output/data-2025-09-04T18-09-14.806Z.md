## Details
- **Prep Time:** 30 minutes
- **Bake Time:** 35-40 minutes at 350°F (175°C)
- **Total Time:** 3-4 hours (including proofing)
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Yields:** 1 loaves

## Ingredients
1. 3 cups (360g) bread flour, plus more for dusting
2. 1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
3. 1 1/4 cups (300ml) warm water (105-115°F)
4. 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
5. 1 teaspoon salt
6. 1/4 cup (60ml) peanut butter, smooth or crunchy
7. 1/2 cup (120ml) grape jelly or your favorite flavor
8. Egg wash (1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, for brushing)

## Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it stand for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
2. Add the bread flour and salt to the yeast mixture. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer with a dough hook for 6-8 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat. Cover and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.
5. Gently punch down the dough. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle (about 12x18 inches).
6. Spread the peanut butter evenly over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border along one long side.
7. Spoon the jelly over the peanut butter layer, again leaving the 1-inch border.
8. Starting from the long side opposite the border, tightly roll the dough into a log. Pinch the seam to seal.
9. Place the log seam-side down in a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan.
10. Cover and let it rise for another 45-60 minutes, or until almost doubled.
11. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush the top of the loaf with the egg wash.
12. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
13. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice and enjoy!

## Tips
- For a more pronounced peanut butter flavor, use a peanut butter with added salt.
- Experiment with different types of jelly – strawberry, raspberry, or even a homemade jam would be delicious.
- If the loaf browns too quickly, tent it with foil during the last 10-15 minutes of baking.
- This bread is best served fresh. Store leftovers in an airtight container or wrap tightly in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 2 days.
